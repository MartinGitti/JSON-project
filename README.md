# JSON-project
Working with JavaScript Object Notation for the first time. Taking a look at JSON syntax, objects and methods.

## Page examples:

### Project 1, Page View:
* The first webpage allows a user to store information of their favorite songs that involves the artist, title, album, genre etc.
* All the info added by a user is displayed and listed on the webpage.
* The user will be able to remove or edit any of the songs that they've added to the list.

### Use of code:
<p>Please feel free to use the code of the projects above.</p>
<p>I've made use of a text editor to put all of my code together and used Google Chrome as my default browser to view my Web Pages.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, I'd suggest using a Text Editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</p>
